# About me
Hi! My name is Shi Jun (he/him). I am from Singapore, and will be moving to Maryland, USA, for my PhD in Fall 2023. My interests are in using satellite remote sensing to investigate the trends, drivers, and impacts of land-cover/land-use change and its interactions with climate change, with a focus on tropical regions. I will be working in the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Xiao-Peng Song.
